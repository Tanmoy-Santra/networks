pipe
----
pipe is a interpoces communiation . occur in half duplex mode . 2 end communication ,one end write and another write not a same time. each occur at a time .

fd (file descripter value)
--------------------------
fd[1]-->write fd[0]-->read 

What is fd in file handling?

In Unix and Unix-like computer operating systems, a file descriptor (FD, less frequently fildes) is a process-unique identifier (handle) for a file or other input/output resource, such as a pipe or network socket.

Common File Descriptor Values:

0: Standard input (stdin).
1: Standard output (stdout).
2: Standard error (stderr)

process 
-------------
A process is an instance of a running program. It is the execution context within which a program runs, including its code, data, resources, and state. Here are the key aspects and components of a process:


======================================================================================================

sys/socket.h, sys/types.h: For socket-related functions and data types.
netinet/in.h: For sockaddr_in structure and constants.
arpa/inet.h: For functions to manipulate IP addresses.

sockaddr_in client, server: Structures to hold client and server address information.

bzero Function
---------------
The bzero function is used to set a block of memory to zero. It is defined in the <strings.h> header, and its prototype is:
void bzero(void *s, size_t n);
s: Pointer to the memory block to be filled with zeros.
n: Number of bytes to set to zero.

bzero((char*)&client, sizeof(client)): Zeroes out the client structure.
client.sin_family = AF_INET: Specifies the address family (IPv4).
client.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr(CLIENT_IP): Sets the client IP address.
client.sin_port = htons(CLIENT_PORT): Sets the client port number (converted to network byte order).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
socket
-------
A socket is one endpoint of a two way communication link between two programs running on the network. The socket mechanism provides a means of inter-process communication (IPC) by establishing named contact points between which the communication take place. 

Like ‘Pipe’ is used to create pipes and sockets is created using ‘socket’ system call. The socket provides bidirectional FIFO Communication facility over the network. 


onnect(sd, (struct sockaddr*)&server, sizeof(server));
connect Function:

The connect function establishes a connection to a specified server using the socket file descriptor returned by socket.
Parameters:

sd: The socket file descriptor created by the socket function.
(struct sockaddr*)&server: A pointer to a sockaddr structure (cast to struct sockaddr*) that contains the server's address and port information. In this case, server is a sockaddr_in structure that specifies the IPv4 address and port of the server.
sizeof(server): The size of the server structure, which is passed to inform the connect function of the length of the address structure.
